Imptovements to work with multiple spaces:

System Preferences > Mission Control > Uncheck "When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application"

and map to switching withing the space to different keys, `CMD + TAB` for example, and switching between spaces to `CTR + F4` (it iwll switch shortcuts between each other)

OR

System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Disable "Move focus to active or next window"
